My useful bits and pieces


Items Overview:
* http_check - A drop in replacement for Nagios-Plugins check_http written in bash (uses curl) for support with things like Cygwin/MobaXterm
* connectwifi - A script for switching between pre-configured wpa-supplicant Wifi networks on Linux.
* Windows - A script for opening a reverse SSH tunnel to a remote PC, which in turn is running Windows (or another OS) in Virtualbox, and has Remote Viewing enabled (but is restricted to localhost only, hence the reverse tunnel requirement.)
* gpg_fix.sh - A quick utility that takes the GPG key ID output by apt after adding an unknown repo, and grabs the PUBKEY to make apt happy again.
